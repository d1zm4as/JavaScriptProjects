<h1>Blockhain basics</h1>


<p> <i>Smart Contracts</i> are a set of instructions executed in a decentralized way without the need for a centralized or third party intermediary, stored inside a blockchain, they are immutable (<i>meaning that once they are created, they cant never be changed again</i>) and distributed (<i>meaning that the output of the contract is validaded by everyone on the network, so if someone on the network forces the contract to reach the end, the others people on the network can stop it from happening</i>). </p>


<p> <i>Blockchains</i> are a chain of blocks that contain information, created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009([[#^ef83fd]]) </p>
