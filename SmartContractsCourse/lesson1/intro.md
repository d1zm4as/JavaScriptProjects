<h1>Blockchain basics</h1>


 <h3><i>Smart Contracts</i></h3> <p>Are a set of instructions executed in a decentralized way without the need for a centralized or third party intermediary, stored inside a blockchain, they are immutable (<i>meaning that once they are created, they cant never be changed again</i>) and distributed (<i>meaning that the output of the contract is validated by everyone on the network, so if someone on the network forces the contract to reach the end, the others people on the network can stop it from happening</i>) and transparent (<i>everyone can see the terms of the agreement</i>). The whole idea is to create trust minimized agreements via unbreakable promises.</p>


<h3><i>Blockchains</i></h3> <p>Are a chain of blocks that contain information, created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, once a piece of data is recorded inside a blockchain is very difficult to change it, each block contains Data(<i>the type of data depends on the type of blockchain, ex the ones from  bitcoin store the sender, the receiver and the amount</i>), Hash(<i>The fingertip of the block, his identification, when the block is created its hash is calculated, changing something inside it will make the hash change as well</i>), Hash of previous block, the first block of the chain(<i>Genesis block</i>) cant point to any previous by definition.</p>
